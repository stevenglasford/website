<heading>Welcome</heading>

glasford.io is currently under construction. But please allow for a quick introduction.

<heading>Globos.us</heading>
glasford.io was created by Steven Glasford many years ago in 2015, as a collection of projects that he made. Originally the organization was called "globos.us".
Globosus never really materialized and in 2018 Steven tried to make a security devices that allowed for unfettered access to any HID machine terminal.
Unfortunately, this endevour was created while Steven was in school and the school (SDSMT) didn't like how all of its security devices were suddenly useless,
Steven also made the unfortunate decision to host the code and other information on his school GitLab account. The school then expelled Steven, which also
meant the end of the original Globosus endevours.

Globosus is a portmanteau of global and us separated by a single unitary circle (o), it is also a small spider native to North America.

glasford.io is the latest and more official company. 

<heading>How did glasford.io start</heading>
<subheading>Failing of Blockchain</subheading>
glasford.io originally was a repository for blog posts that Steven made in 2022. At this time Steven was working for a failing blockchain startup.
The startup didn't have any real products and it felt like Steven was always scamming people out of their money. So Steven made a long term plan.
Steven decided to move to Minneapolis from Boston, this decision took a large number of months to decide. But Minneapolis was chosen due to its
progressiveness revitalization from the death of George Floyd, its centralization to friends and family to Steven. Minneapolis is easily accessible
from anywhere in the world. Minneapolis is far away from the sea and is much more climate resistant that other cities of its size around the US.
Steven expects to live and work in Minneapolis for a very long time.

Steven moved to Minneapolis for multiple reasons, one of the biggest is that it is a very bikable city. Steven and his partner wanted to live somewhere 
where they wouldn't need a car in order to live, this would give them the ability to have a family and would free up time for both parents in the event 
that we wanted to have children. The children can bike to their friends or to school. Furthermore, the city is very diverse so his children would be
less likely to develop racist behaviors and actions that are common in rural parts of America. The list of reasons for Minneapolis are quite long,
so I will skip many of the other reasons.

At first Steven enjoyed working on the blockchain job and enjoyed working with coworkers but the company he was working at took a sudden and uncontrolled 
shift away from standard engineering work, and the company stopped paying for an increase in duties from the original stated job duties. 
Management took steps away and management ceased to really exist in a manor that allowed for personal growth at the company. Eventually the company
started to act much more agressive against questions against management within the organization and the direction of the company.

It was extremely obvious from an outside observer that blockchain and most crypto currencies largely rely on other businesses of the same sort to generate
a sort of bubble of web3, this is appearant due to FTX collapsing, while not really affecting any other companies other than other crypto and blockchain companies.

Seeing that FTX collapsed and the insularity of web3 Steven began making moves to remove himself from web3. This led Steven to begin to question his life 
and his purpose within the world. He noticed many things the more he began search for actual problems in the world. Things such as hunger, poverty,
homelessness, housing affordability, education, ADA compliance, polution, the destruction of natural resources in an effort to create ultra short-term profits.

Steven eventually began making plans to solve a few of these by reducing plastic polution by creating a new mechanisms of sale and profit from 3d printed 
materials using biodegradable materials.

In December 2022, Steven got his first 3d printer (and Ender 3) and began to make plans to grow a print shop in the case that he would be laid off, the
original idea didn't have the breadth of ideas, such as 3d printed furniture.

Then Steven started to only travel via Amtrak. He made regular commutes from MSP to New York City, which taught him and allowed him to meet many
different people. Steven would take different routes often times and on one east-bound route from Chicago to Washington DC he met several representatives
from Green Peace. After a long discussion the representative thought the best thing would be to reduce the amount of oil being pumped out of the ground.
So Steven began researching more about PLA plastics, which are typcially sourced from American grown corn. It takes about 2kg of raw corn to produce 1kg
of PLA plastic, so it is extremly efficient. Many critics often argue about the environmental benefits of PLA plastic, such critism is as follows:
1. The creation of PLA plastic reduces the food supply.
2. Current generation techniques for generating PLA plastic use carbon (such as tractors).
3. PLA takes about 80 years to decompose naturally.

We at glasford.io do not see any problems with the above for the following reasons:
1. Most corn produced in America goes towards animal feed and ethanol production, PLA plastic will never take as much resources as either of these industries.
2. America is already infested with cars so this is true with every single industry and person in America.
3. 80 years to decompose is significantly faster than the 1000+ years needed to break down most other plastics.
The problems of PLA are often conflated and exagerated by the plastic industry in an effort to sell more polution causing plastic. That is the official
stance and opinion of glasford.io.

The conversation with Green Peace also resulted in many other standard practices at glasford.io. Many other people also provided more ideas, we at 
glasford.io thank all others that had converations with Steven over the time. 

Steven's plans were put into effect on 2-22-2023 when it was announced that Steven would be laid off. This is the official start date of glasford.io.

<heading>What did Steven come up with?</heading>

Steven decided to make a Specific Benefit Corporation, that attempts to ensure ADA compliance for the streets of Minneapolis (though our charter specifies 
whatever city we move into, so if we expand to Chicago we will do the same mission), regardless of season. 
The corporation also attempts to reduce carbon emissions, and tries to make life easier, more comfortable and livable for people living in cities without
a car. 

The official name of glasford.io is "glasford.io sbc" please note how it is not "inc" or "llc".
