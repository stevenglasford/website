        <h1>Welcome to glasford.io</h1>

        <p>
            glasford.io is currently under construction. But please allow for a quick introduction.
        </p>

        <p> Glasford.io is a General Benefit Corporation based in Minneapolis, MN. We make 3d printed fully recyclable plant based furniture.
            All of our furniture is designed to reduce the impact on the environment.

            Our unique method of 3d printing furniture reduces the amount of material needed to make furniture. This makes our furniture extremely lightweight.
            For example, our couch model weighs about 10 kg, whereas a regular couch can weigh 100kg. This lower weight might seem like a disadvantage, but 
            the method that we print actually makes this lighter couch magnitudes more sturdy and resilient than a typical couch.
        </p>

        <h2> 
            As of May 22, 2023. 
        </h2>
        <p>    
            It was decided to make glasford.io fully open source. This was largely due to a few reasons, but the largest reason was due 
            to a realization by Steven that the best method to decrease the amount of carbon in the atmoshpere is to allow for all people to use
            the models and the ideas proposed by glasford.io. 
            
            The biggest and most hopeful outlook is for others to try 3d printing furniture as well, and to reduce the shipping time and distance for furniture manufacturing.
            As of May 22, 2023. The project with the most support is the "Little Table" also known as "glaslt". 

            The next steps for glasford.io is to create a shopping website that is able to dynamically schedule prints across multiple printers.

            glasford.io largely prints using conveyer belt printing, but the hope is to allow for the shopping website to be used with any 3d printer running octoprint.

            Please stay tuned for the actual launch of the shopping webite soon, many other things must be worked out first. In particular, recently 
            one of my printers destroyed its control board, and alternatives must be programmed.

        <!-- <h1>Globos.us</h1>
        <p>
            glasford.io was created by Steven Glasford many years ago in 2015, as a collection of projects that he made. Originally the organization was called "globos.us".
            Globosus never really materialized and in 2018 Steven tried to make a security devices that allowed for unfettered access to any HID machine terminal.
            Unfortunately, this endevour was created while Steven was in school and the school (SDSMT) didn't like how all of its security devices were suddenly useless,
            Steven also made the unfortunate decision to host the code and other information on his school GitLab account. The school then expelled Steven, which also
            meant the end of the original Globosus endevours.
        </p>
        <p>
            Globosus was a portmanteau of global and us separated by a single unitary circle (o), it is also the brown little spider common to buildings all over the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            glasford.io has superceeded globos.us, and it the official company. 
        </p>


        <h1>How did glasford.io start?</h1>
        <h2>Part 1: taxes</h2>
        <p>
            Steven used to work at Fast Enterprises based in Boston, MA, he enjoyed this work and felt that his work actually affected people's lives
            in a demonstrable way. He worked on the Audit department. This job however didn't allow Steven to flex a mind more built for engineering
            solutions to the world's problems.
        </p>
        <h2>Part 2: Steven as an Engineer.</h2>
        <p> 
            Steven was able to find a different job that, at the beginnging, was mostly engineering focused. At this point he pivoted and got a job at a 
            blockchain startup based in NY. He also moved to Minneapolis.
            Steven moved to Minneapolis for multiple reasons, one of the biggest is that it is a very bikable city. Steven and his partner wanted to live somewhere 
            where they wouldn't need a car in order to live, this would give them the ability to have a family and would free up time for both parents in the event 
            that we wanted to have children. The children can bike to their friends or to school. Furthermore, the city is very diverse so his children would be
            less likely to develop racist behaviors and actions that are common in rural parts of America. The list of reasons for Minneapolis are quite long,
            so I will skip many of the other reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
            During this time Steven created a personal blog originally called "glasford.io". 
        </p>
        <h2>Part 3: Collapse of blockchain.</h2>
        <p>
            FTX collapsed sometime and Steven realized that blockchain and crypto was an insular bubble with no real innovations. While working at the 
            blockchain startup Steven increasingly felt that he was just contributing to a larger scam. So Steven made a long term plan.
        </p>
        <p>
            glasford.io originally was a repository for blog posts that Steven made in 2022. At this time Steven was working for a blockchain startup.
            The startup didn't have any real products and it felt like Steven was always scamming people out of their money. So Steven made a long term plan.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the collapse of FTX the blockchain company removed Steven's engineering duties and his job became useless as the company began to flounder
            for ideas to stay alive. This upset Steven and he wanted to become an engineer again.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was extremely obvious from an outside observer that blockchain and most crypto currencies largely rely on other businesses of the same sort to generate
            a sort of bubble of web3, this is appearant due to FTX collapsing and bringing down many other crypto and blockchain firms.
            The web3 community turned into an echo chamber, the collapse of FTX affected only the web3 community,
            while not really affecting any other companies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Seeing that FTX collapsed and the insularity of web3 Steven began making moves to remove himself from web3. This led Steven to begin to question his life 
            and his purpose within the world. He noticed many things the more he began search for actual problems in the world. Things such as hunger, poverty,
            homelessness, housing affordability, education, ADA compliance, polution, the destruction of natural resources in an effort to create ultra short-term profits.
        </p>
        <p>
            Steven eventually began making plans to solve a few of these by reducing plastic polution by creating a new mechanisms of sale and profit from 3d printed 
            materials using biodegradable materials.
        </p>
        <p>
            In December 2022, Steven got his first 3d printer (and Ender 3) and began to make plans to grow a print shop in the case that he would be laid off, the
            original idea didn't have the breadth of ideas, such as 3d printed furniture.
        </p>

        <h2>Amtrak</h2>
        <p>
            Then Steven started to only travel via Amtrak. He made regular commutes from MSP to New York City, which taught him and allowed him to meet many
            different people. Steven would take different routes often times and on one east-bound route from Chicago to Washington DC he met several representatives
            from Green Peace. After a long discussion the representative thought the best thing would be to reduce the amount of oil being pumped out of the ground.
            So Steven began researching more about PLA plastics, which are typcially sourced from American grown corn. It takes about 2kg of raw corn to produce 1kg
            of PLA plastic, so it is extremly efficient. Many critics often argue about the environmental disadvantages of PLA plastic, such critism are as follows:
        </p>
            <ol>
                <li>The creation of PLA plastic reduces the food supply.</li>
                <li>Current generation techniques for generating PLA plastic use carbon (such as tractors).</li>
                <li>PLA takes about 80 years to decompose naturally.</li>
            </ol>
        <p>
            We at glasford.io do not see any problems with the above for the following reasons:
        </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Most corn produced in America goes towards animal feed and ethanol production, PLA plastic will never take as much resources as either of these industries.</li>
                <li>America is already infested with cars so this is true with every single industry and person in America. We are trying to figure out how to reduce this further.</li>
                <li>80 years to decompose is significantly faster than the 1000+ years needed to break down most other plastics.</li>
            </ol>
        <p>
            The problems of PLA are often conflated and exagerated by the plastic industry in an effort to sell more polution causing plastic. That is the official
            stance and opinion of glasford.io. BP and Exxon sell oil so it is in their best interest to cause confusion around a sustainable plastic.
        <p>
        <p>
            The conversation with Green Peace also resulted in many other standard practices at glasford.io. Many other people also provided more ideas, we at 
            glasford.io thank all others that had converations with Steven over the time. 

        </p>

        <h1>Start</h1>
        <p>
            Steven's plans were put into effect on 2-22-2023 when it was announced that Steven would be laid off. This is the official start date of glasford.io.
        </p>

        <h1>What did Steven come up with?</h1>
            <h2>Idea</h2>
        <p>
            Steven decided to make a Specific Benefit Corporation, that attempts to ensure ADA compliance for the streets of Minneapolis (though our charter specifies 
            whatever city we move into, so if we expand to Chicago we will do the same mission), regardless of season. 
            The corporation also attempts to reduce carbon emissions, and tries to make life easier, more comfortable and livable for people living in cities without
            a car. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The official name of glasford.io is "glasford.io SBC" please note how it is not "inc" or "llc". "SBC" stands for a "Specific Benefit Corporation".
        </p>
            <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>
            Our current mission is to ensure people with disabilities are able to use the highly pedestrianized street in Minneapolis called Spruce Place. 
            We do this both manually and politically. We ensure that ice dams are broken to prevent standing water at intersections. We plow the street sidewalks to
            allow for wider sidewalks for better and safer mobility of those in scooters and walkers and those who use sign language.
            We are also in stages of making proposals and designs to change Spruce Place in an effort to widen the sidewalks and ensure buses are better able to traverse
            the narrow street. We are planning on removing a lane of street parking to accomplish this. Our initial designs also allow for more street parking while
            allowing for safer and slower street design and a widened sidewalk. More designs will be created once we soon.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our other mission of decarbonization is as follows and is much more verbose and is the method our organization makes the most of its money.
            We create 3d printed furniture using PLA plastic that is sourced from Minnesota. This local sourcement allows for less transportation carbon.
            The PLA plastic reduces our dependence on oil.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are able to recycle entire printed pieces which allows us to further reduce our use of virgin materials. 
        </p>
        <h1>Current State</h1>
        <p>
            Currently, we are in the process of creating "standard" models. These models are currently held secretly under advice from our lawyers. But once printing 
            starts in April we will charge $666 for each standard printed item (Selling of the models is also an option). 
        </p>
        <p>
            In accordance with our committments to those with disabilites all chairs are custom printed in accordance with the person's real dimensions. 
            This will allow for a "perfect" chair for anyone regardless of weight, height, or age.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once a person buys a model and it is printed, the print will be marked as ready and only low carbon methods will be used to deliver the products.
            Currently this means we literally ship the product and its pieces by e-bicycle within the Twin Cities area, furthermore, the bicycles are charged using 100%
            renewable power. We do not ship outside of the Twin Cities area to prevent excessive carbon being emitted. We currently do not recommend driving to pick up
            your product as this is highly carbon intensive, but we cannot stop people from doing this. Our headquarters in Minneapolis does not have parking, this is
            on purpose. In the event that parking minimums are instituted in Minneapolis again (they were removed in 2014), we will conduct all deliveries via bicycle.
            And our headquarters will become off limits to the public. glasford.io will do all in its power to prevent the creation of another parking space,
            even if this means our dissolution.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a person's body changes in any way, we will happy destroy your model and reprint it for $69. This is great for those who gain weight,
            loose weight, shrink, grow, or anything. We are committed to keeping our ADA compliance and allowing people to reprint their models to better fit their 
            bodies as time passes. This is great for example, for children as well, who obviously grow as they age. Through our unique manufacturing methods a chair can 
            or table or anything else can grow with your child.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are still very much in stage 1 of our growth.
        </p>

        <h1>Future</h1>
        <p>
            We hope to increase the widths of the street sidewalks in Minneapolis, we also hope to expand to the markets in Chicago, New York, and perhaps Denver.
        </p>
        <p>
            We here at glasford.io believe the future is near, and we are taking steps to ensure the future is the best for the future generations.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Please stay tuned, we are just getting started.</b>
